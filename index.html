									<td><p><i>Socially awkward Doug Harris (Josh Gad) is two weeks from marrying the gal (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting) of his dreams, but he has a problem: He doesn't have any groomsmen for the occasion. Desperate and running out of time, Doug calls upon Jimmy Callahan (Kevin Hart), owner and operator of Best Man Inc., a company that provides attendants for friendless grooms. As Doug tries to pull off the con, a bromance unexpectedly blossoms between Jimmy and himself.</i></p></td>

									<td><p><i>Thirty-two-year-old Sonny Koufax (Adam Sandler) has spent his whole life avoiding responsibility. But when his girlfriend dumps him for an older man, he's got to find a way to prove he's ready to grow up. In a desperate last-ditch effort, Sonny adopts 5-year-old Julian (Dylan Sprouse), (Cole Sprouse) to impress her. She's not impressed ... and he can't return the kid. Uh-oh for Sonny!</i></p></td>
									<td><p>Cast</p></td>
									<td><p>Anonymous:</p> <p><i>"I love this movie. As a dad I love rewatching this movie over and over again. Funny but also a tear jerker at times. Sandler gives a hilarious twist to fatherhood."</i></p></td>
