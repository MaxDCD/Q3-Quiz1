									<td>Socially awkward Doug Harris (Josh Gad) is two weeks from marrying the gal (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting) of his dreams, but he has a problem: He doesn't have any groomsmen for the occasion. Desperate and running out of time, Doug calls upon Jimmy Callahan (Kevin Hart), owner and operator of Best Man Inc., a company that provides attendants for friendless grooms. As Doug tries to pull off the con, a bromance unexpectedly blossoms between Jimmy and himself.<br><br></td>

										<i>"A mostly disposable, occasionally quite funny bromance distinguished at times by its earnestness."</i>

										<p><h5>Personal Review:</h5></p> <i>The Wedding Ringer is a must watch for teens 13+ with parental guidance. The silly build up of the plot is well made and can bring you laughs. Despite the lack of background to some characters, the movie is absolutely fun, focusing on relationships, friendship, and teamwork.</i>

										<p><h5>Personal Review:</h5></p> <p><i>Watched this movie with my mother and brother and they absolutely loved the film. It was a fun movie with wholesome, funny, and tear-jerking scenes and the character improvement on Sonny (Adam Sandler) where he slowly tries his best to be a good father figure to Julian (Dylan & Cole Sprouse). This movie is fit for teen audiences with parental guidance.</i></p>

Determined to save their home -- not to mention his -- Shrek cuts a deal with Farquaad and sets out to rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) to be Farquaad's bride.
